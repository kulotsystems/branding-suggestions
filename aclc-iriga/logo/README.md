### Hello there, ACLC College of Iriga
I just noticed that your current Facebook avatar looks
a little stretched with unnecessary white borders
in its cropped form.

#### I would like to suggest replacing it with this:

This contains the same information in your current avatar,
but looks better in circular form.

That would be all. Cheers!
